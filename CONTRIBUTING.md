We welcome additional viewpoints, especially from different parts of the world where the culture of career path may be different. We actively invite others to send us links to resources, training programs, summer schools etc. 

If you'd like to contribute, please open an issue and describe what you'd like to see changed. Alternatively, you can make the change yourself and send me a pull request, which I will review.
